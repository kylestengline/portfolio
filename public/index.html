            Hey! Thanks for visiting. I'm a software engineer based out of San Diego. I’m learning Kung Fu and have been practicing everyday for the past 4.5 years. I enjoy exploring San Diego as well as taking small trips up and down the California coast. I play guitar from time to time, I can juggle and I know how to sail! If you want to hear more, get in touch, I’d be happy to share some stories and talk code.

                  I built this app because I was going through a creative dry spell. I knew I wanted to build something, but wasn't sure what to build. I figured, I like dogs and Petfinder is a pretty cool site, so why not build a similar site, but just for dogs? Out came Dog Seekers. I built Dog Seekers to prove to myself that I was capable of building a large scale project with only the help of Google. In the past, I've implemented features to large projects, but never built an entire large scale project; top-to-bottom. If you're reading this, then I've accomplished exactly what I set out to do. There's still A LOT of work to do, but I've simply come to terms with the fact that I'm going to be working on this for a while. To me, no project is really "finished", because there's always work to be done. Quick sidebar, I had a security team test this app and they confirmed it is up to OWASP Standards.

                <p class="text-display">
                  My personal blog where I share code and general life posts. I'm very proud of this application. When I build a new web app, I implement something I haven't done before. This implementation could be anything from trying out a new ruby gem to a cool ruby/rails method I discovered. In building this blog, I played around with a few gems I found as well as some new ruby methods. I had some fun implementing the ability to write my posts in Markdown format with the Redcarpet and Coderay gems. This was probably one of the most fun apps I've built. I enjoyed its simplicity and playing around with the code and gems. A quick sidebar, I had a security team test this app to ensure it's up to OWASP Standards...yes, it passed.
